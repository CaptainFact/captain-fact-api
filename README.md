# CaptainFact API

## Install

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  
## Configure

### Prod

Following environment variables are required to run in prod. They may be supplied
using environment variables or by using secret files (as generated by docker swarm / kubernettes)
in `/opt/app/secrets`:

* CF_HOST
* CF_PORT
* CF_PORT_SSL
* CF_SECRET_KEY_BASE
* CF_DB_HOSTNAME
* CF_DB_USERNAME
* CF_DB_PASSWORD
* CF_DB_NAME
* CF_FACEBOOK_APP_ID
* CF_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET
* CF_FRONTEND_URL
* CF_CHROME_EXTENSION_ID

You also need to mount two volumes:
  * `/opt/app/ssl-keys`: should contains `cert.pem` and `privkey.pem`
  * `/opt/app/secrets`: if you decide to go with secret files instead of env, this is the place to put your files
  
## Run

Start postgres first, then start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

API is started on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) for http and
[`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) for https.
